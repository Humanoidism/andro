# Andro

**Andro** is a theme for MacRabbit's Espresso, that I made and am using. Expect updates, as I fiddle with the details.
I will also be porting Andro to several other editors in the near future, such as TextMate and Notepad++

You can do whatever the hell you want. Really.
Use it, share it, modify it, smash it against the wall if you feel like it!
Be nice though, I'd appreciate a mention as the original author if you're going to be sharing / building on it.

# Installing Andro

Espresso
--------

Copy the the ``themes/Espresso/Andro.css`` file to ``~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Themes/Andro.css``.
Open up Espresso,  go to ``Preferences âžœ Colors`` and set your "active theme" to Andro.
I also suggest that you use **Monaco 11pt** as your font.

The .SCSS file that I used for generating the ``Andro.css`` file is also available in there, if you decide to edit it yourself.
(If you do, make sure to let me know! I'll gladly accept improvements for it.)
